                        <span class="popuptext" id="myPopup">
                            To enter a token into play from its yard to its starting square, 
                            a player must roll a 6. If the player has no tokens yet in play
                            and rolls other than a 6, the turn passes to the next player. 
                            Once a player has one or more tokens in play, he selects a token
                            and moves it forwards along the track the number of squares indicated by the die. 
                            Players must always move a token according to the die value rolled. 
                            Passes are not allowed; if no move is possible, the turn moves to the next player.
                            When a 6 is rolled, the player may choose to advance a token already in play,
                            or may enter another staged token to its starting square. Rolling a 6 earns the player an additional
                            or "bonus" roll in that turn. If the bonus roll results in a 6 again, the player earns an additional bonus roll.
                            If the third roll is also a 6, the player may not move and the turn immediately passes to the next player.
                            Players may not end their move on a square they already occupy. 
                            If the advance of a token ends on a square occupied by an opponent's token, 
                            the opponent token is returned to its owner's yard. The returned token can 
                            be reentered into play only when the owner rolls a 6. 
                            Unlike Pachisi, there are no "safe" squares on the game track which protect a player's tokens from being returned. 
                            A player's home column squares are always safe, however, since no opponent may enter them.
